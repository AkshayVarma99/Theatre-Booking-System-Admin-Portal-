# Introduction to Create React App

This project utilizes the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) framework for setup.

## Scripts You Can Run

Within the project directory, these commands are available:

### `npm start`

This command runs your application in development mode.\
You can view it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The page will automatically refresh if you modify any files.\
Lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This command starts the test runner in a mode that allows for interactive watching.\
More details are available in the [testing guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command compiles the app for production into the `build` folder.\
It optimally bundles React for production and maximizes efficiency.

The output is compressed, and the file names contain hashes.\
The app is then prepared for deployment.

More deployment information can be found in the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Important: `eject` is irreversible. Once you do it, there's no going back!**

This command is for those who want to override the default tooling and configuration. By ejecting, you will lose the underlying build dependency but gain direct control over the project configurations and dependencies like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.

You will still be able to use other scripts, but they will refer to the newly copied configurations which you can then modify. This tool is meant for advanced optimization and is not mandatory; it is designed to be optional and is best for specific adjustments.

## Additional Information

Further details can be found in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

For React-specific learning, refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
